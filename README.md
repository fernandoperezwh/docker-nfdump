# UC-CEI2023 - "Nfdump" the netflow processing tool

This repository is part of the resources used during the "Congreso de Estudiantes de Ingenier√≠a (CEI2023)".


You can find more information about the netflow processing tools in the [nfdump's repository](https://github.com/phaag/nfdump)


# Prerequisites

The installation of nfdump is done with Docker. Therefore, having docker installed is a must.

It is also necessary to have the netflow files inside the `flows` folder found in this same repository.


# Installation

## 1. Build the docker image

Build the Docker image with the following command.
```bash
docker build -t nfdump .
```

[Optional] You can check the image that was created by listing the docker images.
```bash
docker images
```

## 2. Run a docker container with the image named _"nfdump"_.

Use the next command to create and run a docker container in background with the "nfdump" image.

```bash
docker run -d --name nfdump \
    -v "$(pwd)/flows:/app/flows" \
    -it nfdump
```


[Optional] You can check that the container was created and its status is "running".
```bash
docker ps -a
```

[Optional] If the container is exited, you can start the container with the next command.
```bash
docker start nfdump
```

## 3. Access to the docker container and process the flows with "nfdump"

Once you have your container running, you can access to it with the next command.
```bash
docker exec -it nfdump /bin/bash
```

Run the command below to parse the netflow's files and export in a json file.
```bash
nfdump -R <directory_path> -o json > /app/output.json

# Example
# nfdump -R /app/flows/2023/ -o json > /app/output.json
```
